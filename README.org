#+TITLE: Veil
#+SUBTITLE: Self-hosted cloud gaming platform

* About
Veil is a self-hosted cloud gaming platform that enables you to stream games and applications from your server to a web browser. It uses WebRTC for low-latency streaming and a custom Wayland compositor to capture and transmit graphical output.

* Setup

** Development Environment
The recommended way to set up the development environment is using Dev Containers. This ensures all dependencies are correctly installed and configured, regardless of your local environment.

*** Using Dev Containers (Recommended)
1. Install the prerequisites:
   - Docker
   - Dev Container CLI (https://github.com/devcontainers/cli)

2. Clone the repository
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/veil.git
   cd veil
   #+END_SRC

3. Start the dev container:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
   #+END_SRC

4. Enter the container:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . /bin/zsh
   #+END_SRC

**** Note for GPU Acceleration
If you have an NVIDIA GPU and wish to use it for hardware acceleration:
- Ensure the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed on your host
- The default configuration enables NVIDIA GPU passthrough when available

*** Manual Setup
If you prefer not to use Dev Containers, you'll need to install:
- Node.js (v18+)
- Rust (latest stable)
- pnpm (v9+)
- Buf CLI
- Protocol Buffer compiler

** Quick Start

1. Install dependencies
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   pnpm install
   #+END_SRC

2. Start development environment
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   pnpm dev
   #+END_SRC
